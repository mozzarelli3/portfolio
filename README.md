Plan:

- mini jellybean shaped tags for different languages/tools. show these on each propject. in the toolbox, be able to click on one so it filters through the projects and only shows the projects that use that language/tool.

- title (Ellie Parry). White text, blue and pink (same colours as theme) moving bubbles within the letters. bubbles move with mouse movement.
